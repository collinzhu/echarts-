Basic metrics
- inbound/outbound count/size

What have SMX done for me
- blocked spam/threats
- smartrules usage
- policy deny report
- top targets for spam/threat

What can I improve
- white list report
- unused policy report

Blended reports
- white-list usage, 10 spam/threat recipients matching targets?
